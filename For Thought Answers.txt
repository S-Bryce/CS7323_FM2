1. No, it would not. As it stands the fft graph has a number of points equal to the audio buffer/2 (with audio buffer == Nyquist frequency).
Because of this, if the fft array expanded, it would be attempting to place more points onto the graph than the graph has allocated, which
would cause an error. To correct for this, we would need to increase the numPointsInGraph for the fft graph to match the true size of the
array. Other components would continue to work, as they are proportional to either fftData itself or the size of the audio buffer.

2. In general, pausing is usually more suitable for an application of this type, but for the purpose of this project, deallocating the audio manager would make more sense. This is because the every run of the ViewController reloads the audio file. The file is always reloaded and restarted with every run of ViewController; therefore gaining no advantage from the memory used to keep the audio manager object allocated.
